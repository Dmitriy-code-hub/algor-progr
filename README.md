The mathematical operetions with matrixes, 
what was done as a course project of Algoritmization and Programming.

The first line prompts the user to enter a number from the menu. 
The user has a choice of the following options for mathematical operations with matrices: 
1 - "Adding matrices" 2 - "Subtraction of matrices" 3 - "Multiplication of matrices" 4 - "Separation of matrices" 
5 - "Raising the matrix to the degree" 6 - "Search for the inverse matrix" 7 - "Search for the transposed matrix" 
8 - "Calculation of the determinant of the matrix" To perform arithmetic operations with matrices, 
the user must enter the file name from the keyboard, if the file is saved in the same directory 
with the program or the path to the file in another case, as suggested by the user interface using the following options: 
9 - "Add the first matrix from the file" 10 - "Add a second matrix from the file" The file must be written in .txt format, 
containing the first two values of the matrix dimension and the matrix of the corresponding size. After the calculations, 
the user can write the result to a file using the option: 11 - "Write the result matrix to a file" The file will be written 
in .txt format, containing the first two values of the matrix dimension and the matrix of the corresponding size. 
0 - "Exit the program" With option 0, the user can exit the program.
